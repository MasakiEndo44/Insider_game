## 🚨 Critical Issues

### Issue #1: Room Join Flow Completely Broken (SEVERITY: P0 - BLOCKER)

**Description**: When a second player attempts to join an existing room using the correct passphrase, the server returns a 500 error, preventing any multiplayer gameplay.

**Reproduction Steps**:
1. Player 1 creates room with passphrase `test-prod-` ✅
2. Player 1 enters lobby successfully ✅
3. Player 2 attempts to join with same passphrase `test-prod-` ❌
4. Server returns 500 error with message:
   ```
   An error occurred in the Server Components render. The specific message is omitted
   in production builds to avoid leaking sensitive details. A digest property is included
   on this error instance which may provide additional details about the nature of the error.
   ```

**Root Cause Analysis** (from Supabase logs):
```
GET | 406 Not Acceptable | /rest/v1/rooms
?select=*
&passphrase_hash=eq.%24argon2id%24v%3D19%24m%3D19456%2Ct%3D2%2Cp%3D1%24...
&is_suspended=eq.false
```

**Diagnosis**:
- **HTTP 406 (Not Acceptable)**: Indicates RLS policy or content negotiation failure
- **Likely Causes**:
  1. **RLS Policy Issue**: Row Level Security policies may be blocking unauthenticated reads on `rooms` table
  2. **Argon2id Hash Mismatch**: The passphrase hash comparison might be failing server-side
  3. **Missing Database Index**: Query on `passphrase_hash` column might not be optimized
  4. **Accept Header Issue**: Client/server content type negotiation failing

**Impact**:
- 🔴 **Complete multiplayer functionality is broken**
- 🔴 **No player can join existing rooms**
- 🔴 **Game is effectively single-player only in production**

**Recommended Fix Priority**: **IMMEDIATE (P0)**

**Suggested Solutions**:
1. Review RLS policies on `rooms` table - ensure SELECT is allowed for `passphrase_hash` queries
2. Add server-side error logging to capture full error stack (currently hidden in production)
3. Verify Argon2id hash generation/comparison logic in join flow
4. Add database index: `CREATE INDEX idx_rooms_passphrase_hash ON rooms(passphrase_hash);`
5. Test with `SUPABASE_DEBUG=true` to expose detailed error messages

### 3. Lobby UI Display
**Status**: ✅ PASS (for host)

**Observed Features**:
- Room information panel displaying:
  - Room ID (copyable)
  - Passphrase with copy button
  - Player progress indicator (1/8)
- Player list showing:
  - Host badge for creator
  - 12 player slots (1 filled, 11 empty)

- Game settings panel (host-only):
  - Question phase time limit: 5分（推奨）
  - Topic category: 一般（推奨）
- Invite section with shareable passphrase
- Start game button (disabled, requires 3+ players)

---

## ⚠️ Minor Issues

### Issue #2: Automated Test Selector Mismatches (SEVERITY: P2 - MINOR)

**Description**: Existing Playwright tests fail due to UI text changes between test implementation and production deployment.

**Examples**:
- Expected: `button:has-text("ルームを作成")`
- Actual: `button:has-text("PLAY")`

**Impact**: Automated CI/CD tests will fail, but manual testing is possible

**Fix**: Update test selectors to match production UI:
```diff
- await page.click('button:has-text("ルームを作成")');
+ await page.click('button:has-text("PLAY")');

- await expect(page).toHaveTitle(/Insider Game/i);
+ await expect(page).toHaveTitle(/INSIDER - オンライン推理ゲーム/);
```

## 🎯 Untestable Scenarios (Due to Blocking Bug)

The following critical scenarios **cannot be tested** until Issue #1 is resolved:

### Game Flow Tests
1. ❌ Multi-player join synchronization
2. ❌ Role distribution (1 Master, 1 Insider, N Citizens)
3. ❌ Master rotation logic (excluding previous Master)
4. ❌ Topic visibility (Master: always, Insider: 10s popup, Citizens: hidden)
5. ❌ Timer synchronization (epoch-based across clients)
6. ❌ Question → Debate time inheritance
7. ❌ Vote tallying (majority calculation, tie-breaking)
8. ❌ Runoff voting (up to 3 rounds)
9. ❌ Role secrecy via RLS policies

### Security Tests
1. ❌ RLS prevents role leakage to unauthorized players
2. ❌ Topic data not accessible to Citizens via API
3. ❌ Duplicate passphrase prevention
4. ❌ Nickname collision handling (-2 suffix)

### Performance Tests
1. ❌ 5-8 concurrent players (recommended capacity)
2. ❌ 12 concurrent players (maximum capacity)
3. ❌ Timer drift under network latency
4. ❌ Realtime sync performance

## 🔍 Recommendations

### Immediate Actions (P0)
1. **Fix Room Join Bug**:
   - Enable detailed error logging in production (with digest codes)
   - Review RLS policies on `rooms`, `players`, `roles`, `topics` tables
   - Test passphrase hash comparison logic locally
   - Add integration test for join flow before deploying

2. **Add Database Indexes**:
   ```sql
   CREATE INDEX idx_rooms_passphrase_hash ON rooms(passphrase_hash);
   CREATE INDEX idx_players_room_id ON players(room_id);
   CREATE INDEX idx_roles_session_player ON roles(session_id, player_id);
   ```

3. **Implement Better Error Handling**:
   - Return user-friendly error messages for common scenarios
   - Log full error stack server-side for debugging
   - Add error boundary with retry mechanism

### Short-term Improvements (P1)
1. **Update Automated Tests**:
   - Fix selector mismatches in [e2e/tests/production-smoke.spec.ts](../e2e/tests/production-smoke.spec.ts)
   - Update test fixtures to match production UI
   - Add data-testid attributes for stable selectors

2. **Add Monitoring**:
   - Set up Sentry or similar for production error tracking
   - Add Supabase Realtime connection monitoring
   - Track room join success/failure rates

3. **Security Audit**:
   - Once join works, verify RLS policies prevent role leakage
   - Test unauthorized API access attempts
   - Validate input sanitization (XSS prevention)

### Long-term Enhancements (P2)
1. **Comprehensive E2E Test Suite**:
   - Implement all 13 flows from transition diagrams
   - Add race condition tests (concurrent votes, simultaneous joins)
   - Load testing (30 concurrent rooms as per spec)

2. **Performance Optimization**:
   - Add CDN for static assets
   - Implement optimistic UI updates
   - Reduce Realtime payload sizes

3. **User Experience**:
   - Add loading states for async operations
   - Implement reconnection UI with retry logic
   - Add game phase progress indicator
